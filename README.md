# CNN for ASI
The purpose of this repo is to maintain, and to update the libraries to the newest standards, so that it might be used with the newest version of the libraries, and Python.

This repository contains python/pytorch code for applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on seismic data. The input is a segy-file containing post-stack seismic amplitude data. The training labels are given as images of the training slices, colored to indicate the classes. 

### Setup to get started
CNNs requires time-demanding computations, consider using a computer with a fast NVIDIA GPU with at least 6GB ram.

- Clone this repository<br />
- Set up the environment:
	- If you use Vanilla Python3, use the command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
	- If you use a Scientific conta distribution, use the command:  conda create --name <env> --file Anaconda_Requirements.txt
- Download the demo data set [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7brcf-eGK8CbGhBdmZoUnhiTWs). This is the F3 Netherlands dataset - originally made available by OpenDTect - and available via the [MalenoV Project](https://github.com/bolgebrygg/MalenoV).
- Locate the '.segy'-file, rename it to 'data.segy' and put it in the 'F3'-folder.
 
### How to use tensorboard (for visualization)
- Open a terminal<br />
- cd to the code-folder<br />
- run: tensorboard --logdir='./log'<br />
- Open a web-browser and go to localhost:6006<br />
More information can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard#launching_tensorboard).
  
### Usage
- train.py - train the CNN<br />
- test.py - Example of how the trained CNN can be applied to predict salt in a slice or the full cube. In addition it shows how learned attributes can be extracted.<br />

### Files
In addition, it may be useful to have a look on these files<br/>
- texture_net.py - this is where the network is defined <br/>
- batch.py - provide functionality to generate training batches with random augmentation <br/>
- data.py - load/save data sets with segy-format and labeled slices as images <br/>
- tb_logger.py - connects to the tensorboard functionality <br/>
- utils.py - some help functions <br/>
- test_parallel.py - An implemenation of test.py supporting multi-gpu prediction (thanks to Max Kaznady).<br />

### Using a different data set and custom training labels
If you want to use a different data set, do the following:
- Make a new folder where you place the segy-file
- Make a folder for the training labels
- Save images of the slices you want to train on as 'SLICETYPE_SLICENO.png' (or jpg), where SLICETYPE is either 'inline', 'crossline', or 'timeslice' and SLICENO is the slice number.
- Draw the classes on top of the seismic data, using a simple image editing program with the class colors. Currently up to six classes are supported, indicated by the colors: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta and yellow.
